How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Compares line by line and prints lines that differ.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
The versions can be saved in a more logical fashion, which would make it easier to understand what is being changed and how.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is more code oriented and programs files are often interrelated, so it makes sense that it would allow you to commit multiple files at once. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use the git log to look at the historical versions. Use git diff to compare any two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You have previous versions saved, so if you screw something up, you can return to the saved, unbroken version easily.
